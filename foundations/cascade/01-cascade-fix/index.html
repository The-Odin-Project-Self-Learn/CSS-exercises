    <p class="para">I'm just a paragraph with extra bold text!</p>
    <!--Because both para and small para classes are applied, due to conflict in the font size selector,
    along with the fact that both para and small para are single class selectors, neither is more specific
    than the other, so the position in the stylesheet acts as the tie-breaker-->
    <p class="para small-para">I'm a smaller paragraph, also with extra bold text!</p>

    <!--Similarly, both "confirm" and "button" class selectors will apply to this button, but due to
    conflicts in color and background, and the fact that neither is more specific, the position of the 
    declaration blocks in the stylesheet will break the color and background ties-->
    <button id="confirm-button" class="button confirm">Confirm</button>
    <!--Because there is no "cancel" class, only the button class selector will apply to this button-->
    <button id="cancel-button" class="button cancel">Cancel</button>

    <div class="text">I'm a div with thin text!</div>
    <div class="text">I'm a div with thin text and a child div!
      <!--Because the "text" class selector was also chained with a div type selector, it had higher
      specificity and thus the "child" class selectors' font-weight and font-size attributes were being
      ignored. We removed the div type selector and changed the position of the two declaration blocks
      to ensure that the "chid" class selectors' attributes take precedence due to its position in the
      stylesheet, since now both declaration blocks have one class selector, removing specificity between
      the two-->
      <div class="text child">I'm a smaller child div with extra bold text.</div>
